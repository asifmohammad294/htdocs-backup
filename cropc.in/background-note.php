                          <p>Early warning of natural disasters and community centric impact based forecast has
                              emerged vital in management of disasters. This assumes greater importance since the climate
                              change generated extremities are on rise with pollution adding new dimension to it. Indian
                              Metrological Department ( www.imd.gov.in ) under Ministry of Earth Science is the nodal and
                              official weather forecast agency and it regularly and promptly issues desired alerts and
                              advisories to states /target areas. Our Tsunami Cyclone Warning system is one of the most
                              precise cyclone warning system. Indian S pace Research Organization (ISRO) has dedicated
                              weather satellite INSAT3D with complete observation hosted through National Remote Sensing
                              Center ( NRSC) at its National Database for Emergency Management https://nrsc.gov.in/NDEM.
                              There are other institutions like INCOIS, National Oceanographic Institute, Goa, National
                              Atmospheric Research Laboratory, Tirupati, Snow &amp; Avalanche Study Establishments (SASE),
                              Manali and a number of national and international agencies along with various private players
                              contributing to early warning inputs about hazards. However, there seems to be a gap post IMD
                              at state level to community. The dissemination of required hazard alert to effected masses on
                              time is major issue which results in huge loss to life and property.

                          <p>Climate Change extremities have caused an economic loss of 2245 billion US Dollar
                            worldwide and India ranks 4 th in world and accounts for 20% of same with estimated economic
                            loss of 79.5 Billion US Dollar in last 20 years 1988-2017 as per the UNISDR Report published on
                            the occasion of International Disaster Risk Reduction Day on 13 October 2018. It has been
                            observed that even during recent Kerala Floods in August 2018, there has been huge loss to life
                            and property amounting to more than 35000 INR . Similarly, weather extremities have caused

                            extensive damage in North East, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh ,
                            Uttarakhand etc. Recent cyclones Titli and Gaja too have exposed gaps in our system .Though
                            India has done considerable progress in terms of weather forecast and hazard early warning, its
                            outreach to community is still major issue. There is gap in availability of observing systems and
                            technical experts to decipher the IMDâ€™s early warning and take it down to community. The
                            impact based community centric forecast is one the major lacunae in Indian Disaster
                            Management system resulting in recurring losses to life and property . Dissemination of hazard
                            warning upto last mile is next challenge which needs to improved to enhance preparedness .
